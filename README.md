Projects related to statistics, data minining. 

## [Classification of Turkish Politians Tweets](Tweets_Classification.ipynb)
Analysis and Classification of Turkish Politicians' Tweets using various methods.

In this project, tweets from 4 political leaders of Turkey are analyzed and classifed.
In order for classification algorithms (and any other statistical learning algorithm) to work, 
the pure texts need to be transformed to vectors/features. 
For this purpose following methods are used:

- Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-idf)
- Word Counts
- Tf - idf with Normalized Entropy Boosting
- Word2vec

After each of these preprocessing methods following classification methods are applied and compared:

- Logistic regression
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Classifier
- Random Forest

Finaly some further analysis is made to have a better understanding of the data and the results.

## [Bayesian Statistics - MCMC](Bayesian_Stats.md)


Bayesian analysis and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods applied on a dataset taken from http://www.openbugs.net/Examples/Seeds.html.


## [Lyrics Scraping and Search Engine](Lyrics_project.ipynb)

Lyrics gathered from a website and analyzed. Furthermore a basic search engine is built by returning relevant lyrics given a query.
